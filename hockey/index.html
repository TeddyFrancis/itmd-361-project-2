    <h2>Playing Career</h2>
      <section class="hockey">
        <h3>MIHA Hockey</h3>
          <p>
            Teddy Francis currently plays in the Midwest Inline Hockey
            Association (MIHA). He wears number 6 and plays forward for the
            tier 2 Windy City Syndicate Black (formerly South). The upcoming
            2017-2018 season will be his second with the team.
          </p>
          <p>
            During his rookie campaign, Francis amassed a total of 21 points in
            21 games. 10 of those points were goals and 11 were assists. Number
            6 was a very integral part of the teams penalty killing efforts
            which was much needed because of the teams inability to stay out of
            the penalty box. South led the league in penalty minutes by a large
            margin.
          </p>
          <p>
            The tier 2 South team lost in the semifinals during championship
            weekend to their rivals to the North, Windy City Syndicate North.
            The final score of the game was 7-5. This was only the second time
            these teams matched up during the season. The other was a 4-3 win
            for the South during the championship game at the first tournament
            in Chicago.
          </p>
          <p>
            Following the season, Nick Anderson of the Homer Glen Hockey
            Magazine caught up with Francis. He was able to get some time to ask
            questions during locker clean out day.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li class="interviewer">
              Anderson: "You were not able to make the championship game at
              the final weekend this year. Being the ultimate goa of your
              team, does that make this season a failure?"
            </li>
            <li class="interviewee">
              Francis: "Not at all. We played well enough to give ourselves
              a chance to win and the puck did not bounce our way that game.
              To say this year was a failure is foolish. We won 1 tournament
              and made the championship game in 2 others. We lost to the
              team who won the championship last year. No one is hanging
              their heads in this locker room."
            </li>
            <li class="interviewer">
              Anderson: "You managed to average one point per game in your
              rookie campaign. Can you comment on the success that you
              were able to have?"
            </li>
            <li class="interviewee">
              Francis: "I was fortunate to be on such a good team that
              had some very experienced players on the roster. Those guys
              made it very comfortable for me to fit into the team and
              go out on the ice and play my game."
            </li>
            <li class="interviewer">
              Anderson: "I appreciate the time, just one more question.
              What do you guys have to do to achieve your ultimate goal
              next season?"
            </li>
            <li class="interviewee">
              Francis: "As a team, we just need to keep putting in the work
              at the practice rink and in the weight room. We are close, but
              there is still a lot of work to be done to get to where we
              ultimately want to be."
