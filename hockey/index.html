                Teddy Francis currently plays in the Midwest Inline Hockey
                Association (MIHA). He wears number 6 and plays forward for the
                tier 2 Windy City Syndicate Black (formerly South). The upcoming
                2017-2018 season will be his second with the team.

                The season has started out slow for the tier 2 Windy City
                Syndicate Black squad. The team failed to make it out of the
                quarterfinals during their first tournament. The weekend started
                out with a shootout loss to their rivals, Windy City Syndicate
                Red. It was an exciting game that had action up and down the
                rink. They beat West Michigan Gong Show in a high scoring affair
                before losing in their playoff game to Detroit Rink Rat.

                The team had another rough weekend in Detroit. This was the team's
                November tournament. Their first game was another tough loss to
                Detroit Rink Rat. Black bounced back with a win in their second game
                against the Buffalo City Hawks. In the playoffs, the team
                suffered a crushing defeat against the Detroit Knights. It was a
                game that Black controlled for the most part. That can be said for
                much of the weekend except for penalties. Black proved once again
                that games cannot be won from the penalty box.

                During his rookie campaign, Francis amassed a total of 21 points in
                21 games. 10 of those points were goals and 11 were assists. Number
                6 was a very integral part of the teams penalty killing efforts
                which was much needed because of the teams inability to stay out of
                the penalty box. South led the league in penalty minutes by a large
                margin.

                The tier 2 South team lost in the semifinals during championship
                weekend to their rivals to the North, Windy City Syndicate North.
                The final score of the game was 7-5. This was only the second time
                these teams matched up during the season. The other was a 4-3 win
                for the South during the championship game at the first tournament
                in Chicago.
              </p>

                Following the season, Nick Anderson of the Homer Glen Hockey
                Magazine caught up with Francis. He was able to get some time to ask
                questions during locker clean out day.

                <li class="interviewer">
                  Anderson: "You were not able to make the championship game at
                  the final weekend this year. Being the ultimate goa of your
                  team, does that make this season a failure?"
                </li>
                <li class="interviewee">
                  Francis: "Not at all. We played well enough to give ourselves
                  a chance to win and the puck did not bounce our way that game.
                  To say this year was a failure is foolish. We won 1 tournament
                  and made the championship game in 2 others. We lost to the
                  team who won the championship last year. No one is hanging
                  their heads in this locker room."
                </li>
                <li class="interviewer">
                  Anderson: "You managed to average one point per game in your
                  rookie campaign. Can you comment on the success that you
                  were able to have?"
                </li>
                <li class="interviewee">
                  Francis: "I was fortunate to be on such a good team that
                  had some very experienced players on the roster. Those guys
                  made it very comfortable for me to fit into the team and
                  go out on the ice and play my game."
                </li>
                <li class="interviewer">
                  Anderson: "I appreciate the time, just one more question.
                  What do you guys have to do to achieve your ultimate goal
                  next season?"
                </li>
                <li class="interviewee">
                  Francis: "As a team, we just need to keep putting in the work
                  at the practice rink and in the weight room. We are close, but
                  there is still a lot of work to be done to get to where we
                  ultimately want to be."
