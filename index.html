        I am urrently in the Master's Program for Information Technology at the
        Illinois Institute of Technology. Outside of school, I enjoy spending
        my time either with family, playing hockey, or playing video games.

      <h3 class="hobby">My Dogs</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            My two dogs provide me with endless amounts of entertainment. Fiona is
            a ten year old black Labrador Retriever. Lucy is a four year old yellow
            Labrador Retriever. These two are inseparable, as seen by the picture
            of them laying together. This is a common occurence in my house. The
            two of them could play in the yard for hours whether that time is
            spent chasing a ball or just chasing each other.

          </li>
          <li>
            These two provide their fair share of trouble around the house also.
            Lucy enjoys being bad. She will grab food off of the counter or go on
            to couch when she should not be up there. But who can get mad at that
            face?
          </li>
          <li>
            Fiona likes to be rude and pushy when it comes to things she wants. She
            will bark incessantly until she gets a cookie (the previous
            Labrador Sophie taught her that trick). Other than that, she does not
            do any wrong. This dog loves your attention and will go to great
            lengths to get it. She will even chew up a kleenex if Lucy is getting
            in trouble so that she can "get in trouble" also.
          </li>
        </ul>
      <h3 class="hobby">Video Games</h3>
        <p>
          I have always been drawn to technology, specifically video games, since
          I was young. My gaming career started with Pokemon Red on the Gameboy
          Color. I spent many hours in the Pokemon world as I grew older (and
          still play today).
          These days, I play mostly Destiny. I also play some No Man's Sky,
          Player Unknown's Battlegrounds, and Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Being
          able to play in different universes as characters that are out of
          this world is something that I truly enjoy. That is why I can see
          myself working for a video game company some day.
